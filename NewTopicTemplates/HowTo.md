Topic Title
===========
Write an introduction that explains what you are showing people how to do and why they would want to do that thing. Try to avoid restating the title.
As general practice, you should always link the first mention of any API to the topic for that API. For example, "Use the [BodyHandPair class](.\KinectSDKv2\md\k4w2\Reference\Kinect_for_Windows_v2\Kinect.Input\BodyHandPair_Class) to distinguish between the users left and right hand..." Also, avoid using long compound sentences, cultural references, and colloquialisms that might not make sense in machine translation. Ideally, you should be able to Bing tranlslate your topic into Japanese and then back to English and still understand what you're talking about.  

Prerequisites [Optional]
========================
If the user needs to do other steps before starting the procedures in your topic, link them here. Ideally, your procedural topics should contain only a single procedure or a closely related series of procedures. Otherwise, it is better to break them out into separate topics.  
Prerequisites that can be described as single steps, such as creating a project or adding a reference, do not require separate topics.

Section 1 [Optional]
=========
Use sections if you are writing a scenario with multiple procedures to summarize what is important to know about the current procedure. You do not need to use sections for simple task documents that only use a single procedure.  

Procedure 1
-----------
1.   Step one.  
    Optional explanation of step one.  
2.   Step two, which happens to contain `inline code`.  
3.   Step three, which has a sub-procedure  
  1.   sub one includes a code sample.  
    CSharp  
    ````  
    // Some sample code here  
    ````  
  2.   sub two.  
4.   There is no step four.

[Optional code sample]
You can show the completed procedure in a single code sample or sample set at the end of the procedure, or show parts of it inline, or both. There is no header for code samples shown this way.
Code sample description [optional] Always include the language name on a line by itself directly above the code, and used the fenced code block syntax as shown below.  
CSharp  
````
// Put your C# code sample here.  
````

CPP  
````
// Put the same sample here in C++.  
````

Section 2
=========
If there's another procedure, summarize what you're doing an why.
Procedure 2
