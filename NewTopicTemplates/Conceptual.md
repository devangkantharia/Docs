Topic Title
===========
Write a brief summary, preferably one to three sentences, describing what this topic is about. If not completely obvious, mention why the reader might care. Try to avoid restating the title.

Section 1
=========
Describe the first big concept here. You are not required to follow MSTP style, but here are some guidelines to help with consistency.  
1.   Link the first mention of any API to the topic for that API. For example, "Use the [BodyHandPair class](.\KinectSDKv2\md\k4w2\Reference\Kinect_for_Windows_v2\Kinect.Input\BodyHandPair_Class) to distinguish between the users left and right hand..."  
2.   Avoid long compound sentences, cultural references, and colloquialisms that might not make sense in machine translation. Ideally, you should be able to Bing tranlslate your topic into Japanese and then back to English and still understand what you're talking about.  
3.   Where possible, put the most important information first. If there are significant prerequisites, consider putting them in a separate topic and linking to it.  
4.   If there is code, try to organize your topic in such a way that at least some of the code is near the top so that developers looking for sample code will find it.
5.   Most topics should focus on a single feature, concept, group of closely related concepts, task, or scenario. A small amount of related information can go at the bottom of the page.

Procedure 
---------
(One or more procedures optional in each section)  
Optional short description of procedure  
1.   Step one.  
    Optional explanation of step one.  
2.   Step two, which happens to contain `inline code`.  
3.   Step three, which has a sub-procedure  
  1.   sub one includes a code sample.  
    CSharp  
    ````  
    // Some sample code here  
    ````  
  2.   sub two.  
4.   There is no step four.

Code sample description (optional for each sample. One or more code samples optional for each section.) Always include the language name on a line by itself directly above the code, and used the fenced code block syntax as shown below.  
CSharp  
````
// Put your C# code sample here.  
````

CPP  
````
// Put the same sample here in C++.  
````

Section 2

Section two content.

Section 3
