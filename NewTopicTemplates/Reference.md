Topic Title
===========
Write a brief summary, preferably one to three sentences, describing what this topic is about and what context it is used in. Try to avoid restating the title.

Syntax
=======
Put the method syntax in a fenced code block with the name of the language immediately above it, one for each language.  
CSharp  
````
public string SomeMethod(int someNumber, string someString)
````  
C++  
````
public HRESULT SomeMethod etc.
````

####Parameters
*someNumber*  
  Type: int  
  Description of the first parameter  

*someString*  
  Type: string  
  Description of the second parameter  

####Return Value


Remarks
=======
[Optional] This is where you put any relevant information that doesn't fit in the introduction and isn't obvious from the syntax. This might include usage scenarios, security, perf, or anything likely to be relevant that isn't intuitively obvious.
In general, try to:  
1.   Link the first mention of any API to the topic for that API. For example, "Use the [BodyHandPair class](.\KinectSDKv2\md\k4w2\Reference\Kinect_for_Windows_v2\Kinect.Input\BodyHandPair_Class) to distinguish between the users left and right hand..."  
2.   Avoid long compound sentences, cultural references, and colloquialisms that might not make sense in machine translation. Ideally, you should be able to Bing tranlslate your topic into Japanese and then back to English and still understand what you're talking about.  

Samples
=======
[Optional]
Code sample description (optional for each sample. One or more code samples optional for each section.) Always include the language name on a line by itself directly above the code, and used the fenced code block syntax as shown below.  
CSharp  
````
// Put your C# code sample here.  
````

CPP  
````
// Put the same sample here in C++.  
````
