Samples  
=======  

Provides managed and unmanaged code samples using the Kinect for Windows SDK.  
The SDK has a number of samples written in both managed and unmanaged code. The samples demonstrate the way to use the NUI APIs to access color, depth and skeleton data as well as to capture audio and perform speech recognition. The samples are written to perform well and have plenty of error checking in them.
